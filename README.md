Omar Sandoval's dotfiles
========================
This repo contains my workstation configuration, including configuration for
zsh, vim, tmux, GNOME, and more. `install.sh` sets up all of the necessary
configuration file symlinks for various packages. `automated.sh` configures a
freshly-installed Arch Linux system:

    git clone https://github.com/osandov/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ~/.dotfiles/automated.sh
